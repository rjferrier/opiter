# Options Iteration

The classes in this package can be used to assemble and iterate over
combinations of options.  Each set of options is represented by a
dictionary that the client can define with variable values and access
for the purpose of template expansion, input to a binary,
postprocessing, etc.

One application of this is factorial design of experiments.  For
example, given an independent variable `pipe_diameter`, which may take
states [0.10, 0.15], and an independent variable `velocity`, which may
take states [0.01, 0.02, 0.04], we might want to test combinations
(0.10, 0.01), (0.10, 0.02), etc.  These combinations are easily
expressed by creating arrays of options and using the multiplication
operator to produce a tree.
  
```python
pipe_dias  = OptionsArray('pipe_diameter', [0.10, 0.15])
velocities = OptionsArray('velocity', [0.01, 0.02, 0.04])
options_tree = pipe_dias * velocities
```

We might also want to do this for fluids with different properties.
The properties may be represented by a dictionary which is wrapped by
a named `OptionsNode`, or for syntactic convenience they may be
represented by a class.

```python
class water:
    density = 1.00e3
    dynamic_viscosity = 0.89e-3

class ethanol:
    density = 0.79e3
    dynamic_viscosity = 1.09e-3
    
options_tree *= OptionsArray('fluid', [water, ethanol])
```

An options tree may be collapsed to form a single list of options
dictionaries.  Each of these `OptionsDict`s merges a combination of
options which can be accessed either through the usual dictionary
syntax or through the dot operator.  There is also a `str()` method
which can be used to identify the combination.
  
```python
options_dicts = options_tree.collapse()

for opt in options_dicts:
    kinematic_visc = opt.dynamic_viscosity / opt.density
    Re = opt.velocity * opt.pipe_diameter / kinematic_visc
    print '{:20s}: Reynolds number = {:.2e}'.format(opt.str(), Re)
```
  
A serial `for` loop is not the only means of performing a batch of
operations.  The operations can be encoded as a function taking a
single dictionary argument.  This can be passed to a multiprocessing
map function.
  
```python
def calculate_Re(opt):
  kinematic_visc = opt.dynamic_viscosity / opt.density
  return opt.velocity * opt.pipe_diameter / kinematic_visc

p = multiprocessing.Pool(4)
Reynolds_numbers = p.map(calculate_Re, options_dicts)
```

In practice, the client may have to deal with many dependent variables
that would clutter the function body.  For this reason, an
`OptionsDict` has some extra functionality compared to a conventional
dict.  Entries can be defined as dynamic, updating automatically
according to the values of others.  Such dynamic entries might be
added locally, or in a separate dictionary which is then applied
globally.  A caveat is that, if they are defined using non-global
functions such as lambdas, dynamic entries have to be converted back
to static values before multiprocessing.  This is because Python's
`pickle` module has trouble serialising these types of functions.  The
`freeze` function is provided for converting dynamic entries.

```python
fluids.update({
    'kinematic_visc': lambda opt: opt.dynamic_viscosity / opt.density})

options_tree = pipe_dias * velocities * fluids
options_tree.update({
    'Reynolds_number': lambda opt: opt.velocity * opt.pipe_diameter / 
    opt.kinematic_visc})

options_dicts = options_tree.collapse()
Reynolds_numbers = p.map(Lookup('Reynolds_number'), freeze(options_dicts))
```
