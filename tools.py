    Cartesian product of input iterables.

    Equivalent to nested for-loops in a generator expression. For
    example, product(A, B) returns the same as ((x,y) for x in A for y
    in B).

    The nested loops cycle like an odometer with the rightmost element
    advancing on every iteration. This pattern creates a lexicographic
    ordering so that if the input's iterables are sorted, the product
    tuples are emitted in sorted order.

    To compute the product of an iterable with itself, specify the
    number of repetitions with the optional repeat keyword argument. 
    For example, product(A, repeat=4) means the same as 
    product(A, A, A, A).
